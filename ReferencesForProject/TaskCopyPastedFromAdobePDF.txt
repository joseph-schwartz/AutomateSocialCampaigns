FDE Take-Home Exercise: Crea4ve Automa4on for Social Campaigns
Please plan to spend 2-3 hours on the assignment. Complete deliverables described in the task
and be prepared to share what you have created in a 30-minute live presenta;on with the
interviewers.
Required: Please record a quick demo (2-3 minutes) of the exercise working to help the
interviewers set up/run the app locally for review. You will be asked to send the recording to
your Talent Partner at least one day before your scheduled interview.
Scenario: Crea4ve Automa4on for Scalable Social Ad Campaigns
Client: A global consumer goods company launching hundreds of localized social ad campaigns
monthly.
Business Goals:
1. Accelerate campaign velocity: Rapidly ideate, produce, approve, and launch more
campaigns per month to drive localized engagement and conversion.
2. Ensure brand consistency: Maintain global brand guidelines and voice across all markets
and languages.
3. Maximize relevance & personaliza;on: Adapt messaging, offers, and creaLve to
resonate with local cultures, trends, and consumer preferences.
4. Op;mize marke;ng ROI: Increase campaign efficiency by improving performance and
top-line growth (CTR, conversions) versus cost and efficiencies (both Lme and spend).
5. Gain ac;onable insights: Track effecLveness at scale and learn what
content/creaLve/localizaLon drives the best business outcomes.
Pain Points:
1. Manual content crea;on overload: CreaLng and localizing variants for hundreds of
campaigns per month is slow, expensive, and error-prone.
2. Inconsistent quality & messaging: Risk of off-brand or low-quality creaLve due to
decentralized processes and agencies.
3. Slow approval cycles: BoSlenecks in review/approval with mulLple stakeholders in each
region and market.
4. Difficulty analyzing performance at scale: Siloed data and manual reporLng hinder
learning and opLmizaLon.
5. Resource drain: Skilled creaLve and markeLng teams are overloaded with repeLLve
requests versus value-driving work.
Objec;ve: Design a creaLve automaLon pipeline that enables the creaLve team to generate
variaLons for campaign assets.
Data Sources
• User inputs: Campaign briefs and assets uploaded manually.
• Storage: Storage to save generated or transient assets (Can be Azure, AWS or Dropbox)
• GenAI: Best-fit APIs available for generaLng hero images, resized and localized
variaLons.
Task: Build a Crea;ve Automa;on Pipeline (Proof of Concept)
Goal:
Demonstrate a working proof-of-concept that automates creaLve asset generaLon for social ad
campaigns using GenAI. The implementaLon should show your technical approach, problemsolving, and ability to integrate creaLve technologies.
Requirements (minimum)
• Accept a campaign brief (in JSON, YAML, or another reasonable format) with:
o Product(s) – at least two different products
o Target region/market
o Target audience
o Campaign message
• Accept input assets (can be in a local folder or mock storage) and reuse them when
available.
• When assets are missing, generate new ones using a GenAI image model • Produce
creaLves for at least three aspect ra;os (e.g., 1:1, 9:16, 16:9).
• Display campaign message on the final campaign posts (English at least, localized is a
plus).
• Run locally (command-line tool or simple local app; your choice of
language/framework).
• Save generated outputs to a folder, clearly organized by product and aspect raLo.
• Include basic documentaLon (README) explaining:
o How to run it
o Example input and output
o Key design decisions
o Any assumpLons or limitaLons
Nice to Have (op;onal for bonus points)
• Brand compliance checks (e.g., presence of logo, use of brand colors)
• Simple legal content checks (e.g., flagging prohibited words)
• Logging or reporLng of results
Please ensure that your soluLon reflects thougheul design choices and demonstrates a clear
understanding of the code. These aspects will be part of the evaluaLon.
Deliverables: Please share with us the following deliverables for the task
described above:
• A 2–3-minute video of the exercise working to help the interviewers set up/run
the app locally for review.
• A public GitHub repository containing:
o The creaLve automaLon pipeline code
o A comprehensive README file
