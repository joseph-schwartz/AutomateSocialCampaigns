BRAND COMPLIANCE CHECK:
Why this check is needed: Brand compliance ensures the campaign image properly uses the official brand logo and colors to maintain brand consistency and recognition across all marketing materials.

Logo Assessment: [PASS]
- What was checked: Presence and correct usage of brand logo

Color Assessment: [PASS]
- What was checked: Usage of official brand colors
